# 5-day-weather-app
A weather app to see the forcast for specific times and places.
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description
This project has been tasked to me as a stepping stone to working with apis in other words grabbing data from other online sources so that we can use and display it within the browser for our site. The thing that makes this more feasible is that there are  a great number of resourceful apis to choose from not all of these will be paid for and a lot of these companies do not charge to develop using their apis with a certain number of user requests. 

## What was your motivation?
My motivation for this project is that not all weather apps have been created equally some are not as helpful as you might have thought when it comes to reliablility and informational source. With this app alongside the basic criteria for a mvp (minimum viable product) it gives the opportunity to develop further useful features so that I can showcase my skills to future employers or colleagues.

## Why did you build this project? 
I built this project to help find better understanding with working with server third party apis.
##  What problem does it solve?
This project solves the need for accurate weather forecasting which would lead to more relative decision making considering plans on certain days and what or what not to wear on a day.
## What did you learn?

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
Acceptance Criteria
Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.

When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

The city name

The date

An icon representation of weather conditions

The temperature

The humidity

The wind speed

When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:

The date

An icon representation of weather conditions

The temperature

The humidity

When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

Mock-Up
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

The weather app includes a search option, a list of cities, and a five-day forecast and current weather conditions for London.

Grading Requirements
NOTE
If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as ‚Äú0‚Äù, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:

A repository that has no code

A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else

A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else

A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%
Satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus the following:

Uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data.

Uses localStorage to store persistent data.

Deployment: 32%
Application deployed at live URL.

Application loads with no errors.

Application GitHub URL submitted.

GitHub repository that contains application code.

Application Quality: 15%
Application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.

Application user interface style is clean and polished.

Application resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the homework instructions.

Repository Quality: 13%
Repository has a unique name.

Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

Repository contains quality readme file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

Review
You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

The URL of the functional, deployed application.

The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a readme describing the project.

NOTE
You are allowed to miss up to three Challenge assignments and still earn your certificate. If you complete all Challenge assignments, your lowest three grades will be dropped. If you wish to skip this assignment, click Next, and move on to the next Module.

Comments are disabled for graded submissions in BootCamp Spot. If you have questions about your feedback, please notify your instructional staff or the Student Success Advisor. If you would like to resubmit your work for an improved grade, you can use the Resubmit Assignment button to upload new links. You may resubmit up to three times for a total of four submissions.

IMPORTANT
It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.

If you are struggling with a Challenge or any aspect of the curriculum, please remember that there are student support services available for you:

Office hours facilitated by your TA(s)
